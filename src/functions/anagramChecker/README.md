# Anagram Checker

Using functions to abstract the logic away from the rest of
your code makes it easier to read and easier to maintain.

Create a program that compares two strings and determines
if the two strings are anagrams. The program should prompt
for both input strings and display the output as shown in
the example that follows.

## Example Output

Enter two strings and I'll tell you if they
are anagrams:
Enter the first string: note
Enter the second string: tone
"note" and "tone" are anagrams.

## Constraints

Implement the program using a function called isAna-
gram , which takes in two words as its arguments and
returns true or false . Invoke this function from your main
program.

Check that both words are the same length.

## Inputs, Processes, Outputs

Nouns: program, strings, anagrams, output
Verbs: create, compares, determines, prompt, display

## Test Case Example:

Inputs: note, tone
Expected result: "note" and "tone" are anagrams
Actual result:

Inputs: jake, tone
Expected result: "jake" and "tone" are not anagrams
Actual result:

Inputs: golf, flog 
Expected result: "golf" and "flog" are anagrams
Actual result:
